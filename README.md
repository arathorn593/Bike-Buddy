# Bike-Buddy

This code is for an app that reads the microphone input to calculate the speed and distance of a moving bike. The hardware setup consists of a contact mic (plugged into the phone) attached to a wood piece which is attached to the front fork of the bike. A zip tie attached to the tire valve provides a single tick each revolution.
